# Questions 3:
You have seen in the videos how powerful dictionary data structure is.
In this assignment, given a number n, you have to write a program that generates a dictionary d which
contains (i, i*i), where i is from 1 to n (both included).
Then you have to just print this dictionary d.
Example:  
Input: 4  
will give output as  
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}  
Input Format:  
Take the number n in a single line.  
Output Format:  
Print the dictionary d in a single line.  
Example:  
Input:  
8  
Output:  
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

# Questions 4:
There is a robot which wants to go the charging point to charge itself.
The robot moves in a 2-D plane from the original point (0,0). The robot can
move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with given steps.  
The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:  
UP 5  
DOWN 3  
LEFT 3  
RIGHT 2  
Then, the output of the program should be:  
2  
The numbers after the direction are steps.  
Write a program to compute the distance between the current position after
a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then
just print the nearest integer (use round() function for that and then convert
it into an integer).  
Input Format:  
The first line of the input contains a number n which implies the number of
directions to be given.  
The next n lines contain the direction and the step separated by a space.  
Output Format:  
Print the distance from the original position to the current position.  
Example:  
Input:  
4  
UP 5  
DOWN 3  
LEFT 3  
RIGHT 2  
Output:  
2
